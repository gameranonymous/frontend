## Joining our community

As a co-operative, members don't just join the community, they help to run, maintain, and grow it.

Anyone who wishes to be a member of the community agrees to the following principles:

1. Continued respect for the Code of Conduct and being willing to be guided under it.
2. Participation in the support of the community including some of...
  a. Community moderation (see Code of Conduct)
  b. Outreach - this is broad, catch all, and something that I don't feel I have the life-experience to properly define. It may include the following: offering support to marginalized persons, explicitly inviting those who may have had bad experiences in other communities, educating our own members in ways to be better humans who game.
  c. Organising events – Tournemants, Casting, Matches, Meet-ups
  d. Review and implementation of digital infrastructure (code reviews, server maintenance, etc)

Applications are opening soon.
