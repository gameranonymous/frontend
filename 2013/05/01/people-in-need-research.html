<p>In August 2012 I had a cardiac arrest whilst cycling home from work. I woke up in hospital several days later. Thanks to the help of passers by, the ambulance and the hospital I am alive today. However, we discovered that I have a chronic health condition with my heart and the same thing could happen to me again. Thankfully I have been fitted with an implanted cardiac defibrillator, so the worst that is likely to happen to me is that I will be rendered unconscious.</p>

<p>When the police were trying to contact my family, they did not know who I was. I had my staff badge that had my name on it, and a debit card, but nothing with my address. Because this happened on a Friday, work was closed until Monday so no one could contact them. My phone was locked so no one could contact someone from that.</p>

<p>Thankfully the police got my address by contacting the cycle club I am a member of (I was wearing their branded kit). As a result, I woke up to friendly faces. My friends had left familiar things in my room. For me personally, this was a tremendous boost to my mental health. I was also furnished with my own clothing and entertainment. My flatmate informed the hospital of my medical history and which medications I take.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about people who wake up in hospital with none of these things to help them through a traumatic time. I want to try to stop this happening and have a product in mind for smartphones and tablets.</p>

<p>My plan is to collate my assumptions, then release some surveys to test my assumptions. If my hypothesis are confirmed then I will start working on a prototype.</p>
