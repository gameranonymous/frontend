Gamer Anonymous is a co-operative of gamers who want to create a nicer, more inclusive gaming environment to play in.

## The Plan

We aim to create an online gaming environment based on inclusivity, diversity and safety.

We want to enable more people from under represented or diverse groups to enjoy activities in gaming:

- Casting games
- Playing in esports tournements

## Impostors Welcome

If you’re from a background which isn’t well-represented in most gaming groups, come along – we want to make a difference.

If you’re from a background which is well-represented in most gaming groups, come along – we want your help making a difference.

If you’re worried about not being gamer enough, come.

If you think you’re an imposter, come.

This isn’t a group of experts, just people.

We are interested in the social and gaming problems.

This is a support group. No-one knows what they are doing.

## The Rules

A code of conduct applies wherever we gather to talk gamer. This is true both in person and online.

- We want to be inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behavior. Don’t make exclusionary jokes. Don’t even make them "ironically".
- Don’t harass people. Unconsented physical contact or sexual attention is harrassment. Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.
- Aggression and elitism are unwelcome here — gamering is not a competition (except when it's a tournament).
- We’d rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise, and use what they prefer.
- We think feminism is a good thing. Discussion of how to make computer more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this "has gone too far" aren’t.

### Do not

- Use sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, racist or otherwise exclusionary language. Don’t make exclusionary jokes. Don’t even make them "ironically".
- Troll people. Trolling can unintentionally be really hurtful. It is also really easy for people to misinterprit what you are saying
– Harass people.
