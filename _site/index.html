      <p>Gamer Anonymous is a co-operative of gamers who want to create a nicer, more inclusive gaming community.</p>

<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>

<p>We want to provide a community ‘clan’ type environment including Forums, IRC chatrooms, TeamSpeak servers, Casting, e-sports tournaments and more.</p>

<p>We want to enable more people from under represented or diverse groups to enjoy activities in gaming:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Casting games</li>
  <li>Playing in esports tournaments</li>
</ul>

<p>We want to educate by hosting public discussions on inclusivity and diversity, and leading by example.</p>

<h2 id="impostors-welcome">Impostors Welcome</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you’re from a background which is well-represented in most gaming groups, come along – we want your help making a difference.</li>
  <li>If you’re worried about not being gamer enough, come.</li>
  <li>If you think you’re an imposter, come.</li>
  <li>This isn’t a group of experts, just people.</li>
  <li>We are interested in social and gaming problems.</li>
  <li>This is a support group. No-one knows what they are doing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-rules">The Rules</h2>

<p>A code of conduct applies. This is true both in person and online.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We want to be inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behavior. Don’t make exclusionary jokes. Don’t even make them “ironically”.</li>
  <li>Don’t harass people. Unconsented physical contact or sexual attention is harrassment. Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.</li>
  <li>Aggression and elitism are unwelcome here — gamering is not a competition (except when it’s a tournament).</li>
  <li>We’d rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise, and use what they prefer.</li>
  <li>We think feminism is a good thing. Discussion of how to make gamer anonymous more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this “has gone too far” aren’t.</li>
  <li>Trolling is also no welcome. We do not troll other people in or out of our community.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Join us on IRC. We are in #gameranonymous on Freenode.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gameranonymous/frontend">'Fork’ this website</a> then submit a ‘pull-request’, gamer anonymous is a work in progress. If you don’t know how to use github ask on IRC.</li>
  <li>Your help is wanted and appreciated, <a href="https://github.com/gameranonymous/frontend/issues">we have a number of open issues on github</a>. Feel free to participate.</li>
</ul>
